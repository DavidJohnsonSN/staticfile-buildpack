# Cloud Foundry Staticfile Buildpack

[![CF Slack](https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.slack.com) Join us on Slack](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/buildpacks/)

A Cloud Foundry [buildpack](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/) for static content such as websites (HTML/JS/CSS).

## staticfile-lua

This fork uses OpenResty 1.11.2.2, which provides Lua support. As such, we just the language *staticfile-lua* to differentiate this from the standard build pack.

Nginx was built on an Ubuntu 14.04.3 VM:

```
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev libncurses5-dev libpcre3-dev libssl-dev perl make build-essential libgeoip-dev
curl -sSL https://openresty.org/download/openresty-1.11.2.2.tar.gz | tar xzf -
cd openresty-1.11.2.2
./configure --with-luajit --with-pcre-jit --with-ipv6 --prefix=/home/vcap/app
sudo rm -rf /home/vcap/app
sudo make install
tar czvf nginx-1.11.2.2.tgz -C /home/vcap/app .
```

### Buildpack User Documentation

Official buildpack documentation can be found at [staticfile buildpack docs](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/staticfile/index.html).

### Building the Buildpack

To build this buildpack, run the following command from the buildpack's directory:

1. Source the .envrc file in the buildpack directory.

   ```bash
   source .envrc
   ```
   To simplify the process in the future, install [direnv](https://direnv.net/) which will automatically source .envrc when you change directories.

1. Install buildpack-packager

    ```bash
    (cd src/staticfile/vendor/github.com/cloudfoundry/libbuildpack/packager/buildpack-packager && go install)
    ```

1. Build the buildpack

    ```bash
    buildpack-packager [ --cached | --uncached ]
    ```

1. Use in Cloud Foundry

   Upload the buildpack to your Cloud Foundry and optionally specify it by name

    ```bash
    cf create-buildpack [BUILDPACK_NAME] [BUILDPACK_ZIP_FILE_PATH] 1
    cf push my_app [-b BUILDPACK_NAME]
    ```

### Testing

Buildpacks use the [Cutlass](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/libbuildpack/tree/master/cutlass) framework for running integration tests.

To test this buildpack, run the following command from the buildpack's directory:

1. Source the .envrc file in the buildpack directory.

   ```bash
   source .envrc
   ```
   To simplify the process in the future, install [direnv](https://direnv.net/) which will automatically source .envrc when you change directories.

1. Run unit tests

    ```bash
    ./scripts/unit.sh
    ```

1. Run integration tests

    ```bash
    ./scripts/integration.sh
    ```

### Acknowledgements

This buildpack is based heavily upon Jordon Bedwell's Heroku buildpack and the modifications by David Laing for Cloud Foundry [nginx-buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/nginx-buildpack). It has been tuned for usability (configurable with `Staticfile`) and to be included as a default buildpack (detects `Staticfile` rather than the presence of an `index.html`). Thanks for the buildpack Jordon!
